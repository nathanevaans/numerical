# Colours

- Red points are the specific points
- Purple points are uniformly spaced points within two of the given points for the composite interpolant

# Function Inputs

Type an expression in x using LaTeX or otherwise, currently supporting: fractions, trigonometric functions, polynomials, exponents and their compositions

The input is fairly flexible but not every function is supported e.g. hyperbolic trigonometric functions, although you could implement them using their exponential definition

## Examples

- \sin(x), \cos(2x), \exp(x)
- \frac{x}{2}, \sin(x) + \frac{\exp(x)}{2}
- 1 / x, \sin(x) / x^2
- x^2 + 6x^{13}
- x \sin(x), x * \sin(x)


# Add Points

Enter x-coordinate values you want to interpolate at

# Composite

When checked the function is piecewise interpolated using the given points as the end points of each interval

# Composite Input Field

This text input is to specify the degree of the piecewise interpolants
