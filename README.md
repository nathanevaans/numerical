# Colours

- Red points are the specific points
- Purple points are uniformly spaced points within two of the given points for the composite interpolant

# Function Inputs

Type an expression in x using LaTeX or otherwise, currently supporting: fractions, trigonometric functions, polynomials and exponents

## Examples

- \sin(x), \cos(2x), \exp(x)
- \frac{x}{2}, \sin(x) + \frac{\exp(x)}{2}
- x^2 + 6x^{13}

# Add Points

Enter x-coordinate values you want to interpolate at

# Composite

When checked the function is piecewise interpolated using the given points as the end points of each interval

# Composite Input Field

This text input is to specify the degree of the piecewise interpolants
